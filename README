coldkernel by Colin Childs <colin@insecure-complexity.ca> // ColdHak

Place all files into same directory, and run "make". This directory will become messy, so it
is encouraged to create a directory specifically for coldkernel. 

Please see distro specific instructions below.

Debian: 

apt-get install bc wget gnupg fakeroot build-essential devscripts libfile-fcntllock-perl curl
apt-get build-dep linux
apt-get install gcc-4.9-plugin-dev (replace with the version appropriate for your gcc version)

Once built:

sudo dpkg -i linux-*.deb

GIDs:
TPE-trusted = 1005
Deny sockets  = 1004

NOTE: This is still extremely alpha. If it breaks, you get to keep the pieces. There currently 
support for x86_64 only.
